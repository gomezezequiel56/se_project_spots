## Plans for Improvement

My plan to improve is to be able to let users to add and input their own profiles to the website and allow them to edit it. I also need to improve on css techniques to better my ability to do tasks. I need to practice more on this.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
